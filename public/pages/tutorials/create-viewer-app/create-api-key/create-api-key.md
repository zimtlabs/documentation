# Create an API key
We need to create an API key and add it to a permission allowing some of our organization assets, events and documents to be publicly visible in the app using that API key (in this case a viewer app).

### How to:
- Login to the [dashboard](https://dash.zi.mt).
- In left sidebar click on `Organization` > `API keys` > Click icon in top-right corner of the table (New API key).
- Follow images below on how to populate create API key form fields.
- Explanation:
    - Name and description, you describe what API key is meant for.
    - Rest of the fields aren't required for now.
