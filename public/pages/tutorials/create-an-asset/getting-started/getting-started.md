# Getting started

<p class="description">Tutorial for creating an asset and displaying it in the ZIMT Viewer app publicly.</p>

## Prerequisite
- Have a ZIMT account or [register](https://dash.zi.mt/auth/signup) one.

## Description
We will create an asset with 2 events and display it in the ZIMT Viewer app. \
By default all organization assets are private and can only be viewed in the [dashboard](https://dash.zi.mt) (while logged in). \
In order to display assets in an external app, we need to create a permission allowing that external app to get our asset/s.
