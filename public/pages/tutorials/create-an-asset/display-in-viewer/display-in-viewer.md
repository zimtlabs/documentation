# Display in Viewer
Finally, we can view our asset and its events in ZIMT Viewer.

## Recap
1. We created permissions to allow Viewer to get/display our specific organization assets, events and documents.
2. We created an asset and 2 events using asset form, and created another asset with 2 events using JSON input.

## Asset in the Viewer
- Open the [viewer app](https://zi.mt).
- In the search input enter asset_id of asset you want to view.
- Or scan the QR code of an asset from the dashboard.
    - In dashboard click on a title of an asset in assets table.
    - Click `View meta data`.
    - Click on the QR code image to download it.
- If Viewer has permission to view requested asset, it will display the asset information, otherwise display an error.
