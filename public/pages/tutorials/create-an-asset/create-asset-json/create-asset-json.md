# Create asset with JSON input

We will:
- Create an asset and 2 events on that asset, via the JSON. A JSON file contains list of events as lines of code, the form simply creates those lines of code for you, the JSON editor gives you the possibility to create those lines manually or edit what you have created using the form.


## Create asset using JSON input
- In home page (Assets page) or by clicking `Assets` in left sidebar, click the plus icon in top-right corner of the table (New asset).
- Select JSON tab.
- Follow images below on how to use create asset JSON input.
- Explanation:
    - Import, copy or enter asset JSON, which has to be array of events.
    - Clicking create asset, the asset gets created and following that each JSON array object is used to create an event on the previously created asset.
